# CreatingDynamicLayersWithTheirObjectsAndTimelines-C3Module-Code
A very small system which creates dynamic layers from one layout onto another, with the layers objects, and timelines. Useful for creating cutscenes on a cutscene-bank layout and showing them on other layouts where needed (very useful for mid-game cutscenes)
